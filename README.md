# Survival - not-so-parkour - instant game - 3D
  sheees i gotta work that name out.
  this was planned as the 3D version of my first ever game created in Cocos. it was called MuscleMan.

## Getting approach from the infamous old gamee "Flappy Bird"
  the idea is to have:
  - Instant play
  - Instant replay
  - no level
  - no side quest
  - only 1 gameplay
  - randomized obstacle
  - skill-based survival
